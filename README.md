Source code examples used in my presention on Prototyping products for the Internet of Things using JavaScript

## NFC Card Reader Example

This example uses an the [Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID controller breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/364).

Connect `SCL` on the reader to the `B6` pin of the Espruino.   
Connect `SDA` on the reader to the `B7` pin of the Espruino.  
Connect `5V` on the reader to the `5V` pin of the Espruino (left of the `3.3V`).  
Connect `GND` next to the `SCL` pin on the reader to the `GND` pin of the Espruino.

The second display has the `A0` jumper soldered (so it has the address `0x71`),
The third display has the `A1` jumper soldered (so it has the address `0x72`).
